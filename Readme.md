# :blue_square: KEYLOGGER
A keylogger is a form of malware or hardware that keeps track of and records your keystrokes as you type. It takes the information and sends it to a hacker using a command-and-control (C&C) server. The hacker then analyzes the keystrokes to locate usernames and passwords and uses them to hack into otherwise secure systems. Keyloggers are programs or devices that log keystrokes.                                    Keyloggers are dangerous because they specifically read out login data such as names and passwords, and transmit them to unauthorized third parties.This threatens the security of your e-mail passwords, social media accounts,and online banking data. Keyloggers like these are not only used by individual hackers, but also by investigative authorities and intelligence services to spy on confidential data.
